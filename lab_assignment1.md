### Submission requirements:

Submission is via GIT Classroom

TUTORIAL, github can be like words track changes but for code.
## GitHub Pitfalls:


### Many of us have seen this error message before:



```
git pull origin master
From ssh://.../site.git
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
...
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in admin/process_email.php
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
* Its a classic problem that sometimes leads to this git anti pattern:

This problem even happened organically in the creation of this learning material. See below:

### Creating a merge conflict
Getting familiar with merge conflicts via simulation.
```BASH
mkdir git-merge-test
cd git-merge-test
git init .
echo "this is some content to mess with" > merge.txt
git add merge.txt
git commit -am"we are commiting the inital content"
```
```
[main (root-commit) d48e74c] we are commiting the inital content
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
create mode 100644 merge.txt
```
* This code example executes a sequence of commands that accomplish the following.
* Create a new directory named git-merge-test, change to that directory, and initialize it as a new Git repo.
* Create a new text file merge.txt with some content in it.  
* Add merge.txt to the repo and commit it.

Now we have a new repo with one branch main and a file merge.txt with content in it. Next, we will create a new branch to use as the conflicting merge.
```BASH
git checkout -b new_branch_to_merge_later
echo "totally different content to merge later" > merge.txt
git add merge.txt
git commit -am"edited the content of merge.txt to cause a conflict"
```
[new_branch_to_merge_later 6282319] edited the content of merge.txt to cause a conflict
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
The proceeding command sequence achieves the following:

* create and check out a new branch named new_branch_to_merge_later
* overwrite the content in merge.txt  
* commit the new content
With this new branch: new_branch_to_merge_later we have created a commit that overrides the content of merge.txt
```BASH
git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
echo "content to append" >> merge.txt
git add merge.txt
git commit -am"appended content to merge.txt"
```
[main 24fbe3c] appended content to merge.tx
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

This chain of commands checks out the main branch, appends content to merge.txt, and commits it. This now puts our example repo in a state where we have 2 new commits. One in the main branch and one in the new_branch_to_merge_later branch. At this time lets git merge new_branch_to_merge_later and see what happen!
```
$ git merge
```
new_branch_to_merge_later
Auto-merging merge.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in merge.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
# BOOM ðŸ’¥. A conflict appears. Thanks, Git for letting us know about this!

### How to identify merge conflicts
As we have experienced from the proceeding example, Git will produce some descriptive output letting us know that a CONFLICT has occcured. We can gain further insight by running the git status command
```
git status
```
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
(use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

both modified:   merge.txt
The output from git status indicates that there are unmerged paths due to a conflict. The merge.text file now appears in a modified state. Let's examine the file and see whats modified.
 
In the content below, think of these new lines as "conflict dividers". The ======= line is the "center" of the conflict. All the content between the center and the <<<<<<< HEAD line is content that exists in the current branch main which the HEAD ref is pointing to. Alternatively all content between the center and >>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later is content that is present in our merging branch.
 
```BASH
cat merge.txt
```
`<<<<<<<` HEAD
           
this is some content to mess with
content to append
           
`=======`
           
totally different content to merge later

`>>>>>>>` new_branch_to_merge_later

 Here we have used the cat command to put out the contents of the merge.txt file. We can see some strange new additions

`<<<<<<<` HEAD
           
`=======`

```>>>>>>>``` new_branch_to_merge_later


# Resolving the conflict.
 
[How to resolve merge conflicts using the command line](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)
 
The most direct way to resolve a merge conflict is to edit the conflicted file. Open the merge.txt file in your favorite editor. For our example lets simply remove all the conflict dividers. The modified merge.txt content should then look like:

```this is some content to mess with
content to append
totally different content to merge later```
Once the file has been edited use git add merge.txt to stage the new merged content. To finalize the merge create a new commit by executing:

`git commit -m "merged and resolved the conflict in merge.txt"`
Git will see that the conflict has been resolved and creates a new merge commit to finalize the merge.

Git commands that can help resolve merge conflicts
General tools
`git status`
The status command is in frequent use when a working with Git and during a merge it will help identify conflicted files.

`git log --merge`
Passing the --merge argument to the git log command will produce a log with a list of commits that conflict between the merging branches.

`git diff`
diff helps find differences between states of a repository/files. This is useful in predicting and preventing merge conflicts.

Tools for when git fails to start a merge
git checkout
checkout can be used for undoing changes to files, or for changing branches

`git reset --mixed`
reset can be used to undo changes to the working directory and staging area.

Tools for when git conflicts arise during a merge
git merge --abort
Executing git merge with the --abort option will exit from the merge process and return the branch to the state before the merge began.

`git reset`
Git reset can be used during a merge conflict to reset conflicted files to a know good state
